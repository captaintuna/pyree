## IRC Bot for ustream Q's

Hi Dave,

you mentioned on your last live show that the questions asked on irc has to be printed via an old style serial printer.

Luckily I have modified some of my existing ircbot code and came up with this.

It connects you automaticly to ustream's irc and filters all questions starting with a _Q:_ or _q:_

Just modify line 122 and write your printer code on line 90.


I hope this will help you.

\- Timo
